The set of files are used to start and stop Kapow MC and Robots.

kapow_robots.py - This file looks at /opt/<KapowDirectory>/config/robots.conf. Inside robots.conf you should have the port number of each robot you want to run seperated  by a carriage return. For example:

Nothing else should be in the file. Make sure not to leave white space. 

kapowmc.service - systemd script whic should be placed in /etc/systemd/system/ directory. Used to enable and disable the management console

kapowrobots.service - used to run "kapow_robots.py" as a service, and enables and disables the robots.
